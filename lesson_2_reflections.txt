1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When we initialize a repository, it adds a .git file that marks that this is a git repository.
	After this, we will be able to commit the changes and track the versions of the files in this directory.
	Adding this to git helps us to keep track of the changes we make and if needed, to revert those.
	
2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
   Staging area is an intermediate area between working directory and repository. It allows us to choose what goes into 
   repository in each commit
